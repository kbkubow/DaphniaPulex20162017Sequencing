Analyses of Hardy-Weinberg deviations and attempt to cluster based on LD.

> `HWE_simulations.*.*.R`
> These scripts perform analysis showing there is an excess of SNPs that are AA or Aa, consistent with a sex-chromosome like model

> `LD_clump.*.*.R`
> These scripts try to clump SNPs into linkage blocks based on frequency class
