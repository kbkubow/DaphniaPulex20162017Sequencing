1. AB_phasing/ uses whatshapp to trio data to phase A & B haplotypes
2. popPhasing/ uses shapeit to population/readbacked + priors from AB_phasing
3. pooledMF/ does sliding window test (odds_ratio_SWR.R is current one)
4. HWE_scripts/ examines HW deviations, ternary plots, clumping, etc. From ESEB
5. pulicaria/
5.slimulations/ performs forward simulations & analytical models


need to do:

move plotting function of odds_ratio_SWR.R script into new folder/file which summarizes different bits
